# Model benchmarks

Eventually, these will contain a series of benchmarks against a variety of models in the 
dsharp-models repository. The following benchmarks have been implemented:

- Training LeNet against the MNIST dataset
- Performing inference with LeNet using MNIST-sized random images

These benchmarks should provide a baseline to judge performance improvements and regressions in 
DiffSharp.
