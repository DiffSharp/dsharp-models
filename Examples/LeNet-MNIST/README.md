# LeNet-5 with MNIST

This example demonstrates how to train the [LeNet-5 network]( http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf) against the [MNIST digit classification dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

The LeNet network is instantiated from the ImageClassificationModels library of standard models, and applied to an instance of the MNIST dataset. A custom training loop is defined, and the training and test losses and accuracies for each epoch are shown during training.
